      <p>“In the Middle Ages, starting around the 14th century, art took a turn toward the dark when the plague known as the Black Death descended upon Europe like the apocalypse itself. This period was often filled with despair and hopelessness, and for the first time, several different themes revolving around death were developed or more heavily explored.”</br></br>After that, the death theme can be easily found in a massive amount of artworks until now.</br></br>
      This illustration is one of the series work Our Closest Friend. Inspired by the Hans Holbein Younger, the skeleton has been employed as the symbol of death in this series of work based on screen printing, which is my current postgraduate research in London College of Communication, also. Although many religions tried to comfort us not to be afraid of death, all of us have to face the threats of death all the time. In other words, the death is our human beings’ closest friend to some degree.
